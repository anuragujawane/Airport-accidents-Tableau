# INTRODUCTION :-
This paper aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge on the diverse accidents that occur in airports; discuss about their causes and propose feasible preventive measures and or solutions to reduce the damage caused by some unavoidable disasters. This work will aid in construction and maintenance of some much safer and secured airports in the world.
Accidents at airports can have significant impacts on both human lives and infrastructure. Analyzing and understanding the causes and patterns of these accidents is crucial for enhancing safety measures and preventing future incidents. In this analysis, we'll utilize Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to explore airport accidents data and uncover insights that can inform safety protocols and decision-making.

# OBJECTIVES :-

* Data Exploration: Utilize Tableau to visually explore airport accidents data, including the types of accidents, locations, and severity.

* Trend Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in airport accidents over time, including seasonal variations and long-term trends.

* Geospatial Analysis: Visualize the geographical distribution of airport accidents to identify high-risk areas and potential hotspots.

* Causal Factors: Investigate potential causal factors contributing to airport accidents, such as weather conditions, human error, or technical failures.

* Recommendations: Based on the analysis, provide recommendations for improving airport safety protocols and mitigating the risk of accidents in the future.
